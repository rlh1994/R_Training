### Quiz

Some questions to verify that you understand some of the second half of the dplyr training:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("The `mutate` function does which of the following? (select all that apply)",
    answer("Allows you to modify current columns", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Allows you to create new columns based on current columns", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Allows you to create new columns based on new columns you have just created", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Allows you to rename columns"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("What function would you use in a `mutate` to create a column based on a conditional statement",
    answer("`if_else()`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`if(), else if(), else()`"),
    answer("`condition()`"),
    answer("`cases()`"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("A dataframe, `df1` is created with 1 column (col1) and 5 rows, populated with the numbers 1-5.
The following code is then run. What are the values in col4?
```r
df1 %>% mutate(col2 = -col1,
                col3 = 2 * col2,
                col4 = -3 * col3)
```",
    answer("6, 12, 18, 24, 30", correct = TRUE),
    answer("-6, -12, -18, -24, -30"),
    answer("5, 10, 15, 20, 25"),
    answer("-5, -10, -15, -20, -25"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("Sarah has a sales dataframe (`df1`) with 5 columns; day_of_week, month, transaction_ID, transaction_price, number_of_items. She wants to find the mean and standard deviation of the average price per item in each transaction, per day of the week and month. Which code should she use?",
    answer("
    df1 %>% group_by(month, day_of_week) %>% 
           mutate(cost_per_item = transaction_price/number_of_items) %>%

    answer("
