## Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand some of the basics of R:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("What is output of the code `
a <- c(1, 4, 5, 60, 9, 0)
a[4]`",
    answer("NA"),
    answer("5"),
    answer("60", correct = TRUE),
    answer("1")
  ),
  question("What does the `na.rm` parameter do in the `mean()` function?",
    answer("Removes any NAs from the calculation", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Removes any NAs from the argument permenantly"),
    answer("Returns nothing if the function would have returned NA")
  ),
  question("How can I get help while using R? (Select all that apply)",
    answer("Press F1 when the cursor is within a function name", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Search in the help window", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Ask Ryan without having tried all correct options first"),
    answer("Type `?` followed by the function name", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Google R followed by your function and what you are trying to do", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("What type will the vector `c(TRUE, 8, 9.02431, FALSE, 001, NA)` be?",
    answer("Boolean"),
    answer("Character"),
    answer("A mix of types"),
    answer("Numeric", correct = TRUE)
  ),
question("What is the final value of z in the following code?
`y <- 7
Y <- 9
z <- y*10
z <- z/5
",
    answer("90"),
    answer("14", correct = TRUE),
    answer("18"),
    answer("70")
  ),
  question("If I asked you create a vector of numbers starting from 13, ending at 190, in steps of 17, what function would you use to do it?",
    answer("`length()`"),
    answer("`seq()`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`c()`")
  ),
  question("What is wrong with the following code?
`cnt <- 1
while (count != 10){
  print(paste('Count is now', cnt))
  cnt <- cnt + 2
}`",
    answer("Cnt is spelt wrong, it should be count"),
    answer("We should use for loop instead"),
    answer("The loop will never stop", correct = TRUE, message = "Why is this the case?"),
    answer("Count is capitalised in the sentance but cnt isn't")
