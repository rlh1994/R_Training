# Firstly, print out mtcars and have a look at it, use ?mtcars to read the help page about it
# Notice that the row numbers have been replaced by a name, that's because these rows have been specifically labelled

# Exercise 1
# 
# Print out the hp column using the select() function. Try using the pull() function instead of select to see what the difference is.
# 
# 


# 
# Exercise 2
# 
# Print out the all but hp column using the select() function.
# 
# 


# 
# Exercise 3
# 
# Print out the mpg, hp, vs, am, gear columns. Consider using the colon : symbol to simplfy selection of consecutive columns.
# 
# 


# 
# Exercise 4
# 
# Create the object mycars containing the columns mpg, hp columns but let the column names be miles_per_gallon, and horse_power respectively.
# 
# 


# 
# Exercise 5
# 
# Create a new variable in the mycars data frame km_per_litre using the mutate() function. Hint: 1 mpg is 0.425 km/l.
# 
# 


# 
# Exercise 6
# 
# Randomly select and print half the observations of mycars. Hint: consider using the sample_frac() function
# 
# 


# 
# Exercise 7
# 
# Create a mycars_s object, containing from 10th to 35th row of mycars. Hint: Consider using the slice() function.
# 


# 
# Exercise 8
# 
# Print out the mycars_s object without any duplicates. Hint: Consider using the distinct() function.
# 


# 
# Exercise 9
# 
# Print out from mycars_s object all the observations which have mpg>20 and hp>100.

# 
# Exercise 10
# 
# Print out the row corresponding to the Lotus Europa car hint: use the row.names()
