#### What is the grammer of graphics? ####

# In extremely simple terms, the grammer of graphics is the idea that a graphic is like a language,
# it can be made up different pieces, the way a sentence is made of nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.

# By the end of this file you'll be able to plot 5 different variables on the same graphic, now let's get started...

#### Elements of a basic graph ####

# Let's start by adding our data to the plot
ggplot(data = diamonds)

# But there's nothing there? Just a completey blank plot. That's because we have a dictionary,
# words we can use, but haven't put them in a sentence yet!

# Next we can tell the plot what aestetics to use. This is like picking the nouns of our sentance
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))

# We now have some axes, and the ranged are right, but we don't have our data plotted yet.
# We haven't told it how to put it all together yet.

# Now we need to add a geom, these are the elements that get actually added to plot (kind of like verbs)
# Importantly you need to ADD this to the plot, not pipe it like before
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()

# There we go! Our data is plotted in 2 lines.

# It's a bit hard to see because there's so many points, let's make them a bit more transparent using the alpha option
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1 / 100)

# Our Aestetic was set globally, for every geom, but we can overwrite them per geom as well
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = clarity)) # different colours representing the diffeent clarity of each point/diamond

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = cut)) # different colours representing the different cut for each point/diamond

# This opens up a lot of possibilities, we can even change the axis for each geom!
# Of course we now need to change the axis label as well
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, col = "red")) +
  geom_point(aes(x = z, col = "blue")) +
  xlab("Dimension")

# But wait the colours aren't what we said???
# That's because the aestetic just grouped them, we need to add one final option to actually set the colour
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, col = "xs")) +
  geom_point(aes(x = z, col = "zs")) +
  xlab("Dimension") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("xs" = "red", "zs" = "blue"), labels = c("X", "Z"), name = "Custom legend\ntitle")

# Manually specifying things in ggplot is possible, but usually a bit more complex than letting it do it for you
# In particular, anything to do with legends tends to be really fiddely.


#### Exercises 1 ####

# 1) Create a scatter plot that visualises how the width ('x') and depth ('z') of diamond varies



# 2) Are there any outlier values? Remove these from the data then re-plot



# 3) Now have the colour of the points vary by clarity



# 4) Now have the size of the points vary by carat



# 5) Label your axis using xlab() and ylab(), and add a title using ggtitle()




#### Linear Models ####

# We aren't covering modelling in this training, although R is obviously optimised and desgined for it
# But how complex is it to add a linear model to a plot?

# Let's start using our pipes again as well
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Good", color == "J", clarity == "SI1") %>% # compare like for like
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "purple")

# That's it! We've got a linear model (and a loess model) plotted on our data. Be careful, this doesn't tell us anything about
# if the model is any good, or what it might suggest, but it's extremely easy to add.


#### Facets ####

# Now for something even more incredible, we can easily split our plots out by a variable using 1 line
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = clarity)) +
  facet_wrap(~cut) # Notice that ~ for an equation again. This time the equation is the "x" value of the plots

# Or, we can even split it out by two variables!
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = clarity)) +
  facet_grid(color ~ cut)

# because of the ranges, it might be more useful to not have the same ranges on all the axes
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = clarity)) +
  facet_grid(color ~ cut, scales = "free")


#### The big finale ####
library(ggthemes)
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = clarity)) +
  facet_grid(color ~ cut, scales = "free") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  labs(x = "Carat (weight of diamond)", y = "Price ($)", title = "Price of different cut and colour of diamond by weight") +
  theme_minimal()


#### Exercises 2 ####

# 1) Make a plot using mtcars of hp vs mpg, colour it by cylinder
# can you make the cyl discrete? try as.character()



# 2) Now split it out into facets by cylinder instead



# 3) Load the iris datasdet and examine it. Plot Sepal length vs petal length



# 4) Now colour it by the species



# 5) Now split them out using facets and create a line of best fit for each (think about your scales)
# Which species seem to follow a linear trend?



# 6) Use the nycflights13::flights dataset and see if you can work out how to create a boxplot
# of arrival delay, by month, setting the y axis limits to between -20 and 20
# Hint: boxplot only NEEDS a y value




#### But wait, there's more! ####
